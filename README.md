# Deep Learning
## Project: Build an Image Classifier

### Project Summary

I implement an image classification application using a deep learning model
on a dataset of images. I use the trained model to classify new images. The
machine learning library used is PyTorch.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

We recommend students install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.

### Code

The project code is provided in the `Image Classifier Project.ipynb` notebook file.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `image_classifier/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook Image Classifier Project.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook Image Classifier Project.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data

This project uses a dataset consisting of 102 flower categories. Each class
consists of between 40 and 258 images. More information about the dataset
can be obtain from the following URL:

[http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html)

The data should be included alongside this notebook. If it is not, the exact dataset used by this project was taken from Udacity at the following URL:
